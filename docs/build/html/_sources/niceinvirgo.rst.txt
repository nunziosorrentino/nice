NICE in Virgo
=============

The NICE interface is installed on a virtual machine located in the Virgo
farm at Cascina. The database is configured as multiple datasases system. 
The first 3 database are used as archive of the Omicron triggers (link) 
present in O2, O3a and O3b runs. The last one is created for the online 
analysis of the O4 data, with the purpose of updating the it 
periodically with low latency. 

The databases are located in *cmplwebtest* machine. The will we 
transfered in a definitive location for the project final release.

Virgo useres can use NICE behind firewall VPN client and it is provided
through Apache HTTP Server.

The instructions for a prodictive glitch investigation are explained in the
:doc:`investigation flow <investigationflow>` page. Additional tools are
available in the SGAW and are shown below.

Can I download strain timeseries around a glitch?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes, there is a dedicated tool in SGAW page with which you can download 2
seconds of h(t) data around the selected glitch (click *Download Time Series*). 
It returns a hdf file, which you can save locally and make your own 
indipendent analysis.

How many auxiliary channels are available?
------------------------------------------

The auxiliary channels available in NICE database are the DetChar Standard
Channels (link). In **SGAW** page there is a link to the list of channels
coincident triggers at the glitch peak time. Here a *Show Glitches* tool 
is provided, which plot as Q-scan plot as the channels with the glitch.
Below there is an example of an Omicron glitch present in O3b run, with a 
coincidence in the power recycling cavity channel:

Different kinds of coincident channels could suggest the origin of such
a noise. You can download the data around the peak time, as explained above,
and assess that with a deeper analysis.

.. warning::

   The auxiliary channels data are available as long as they remain on
   the farm machines. This means that old runs, like O2 and O3a, contain 
   only the h(t) time-series. 

Are there classified glitches?
------------------------------
To date, in Virgo NICE databases there are no classified glitches. Since 
it contains glitches from O2 run, it will be filled with the classification results of
REINFORCE_ citizen science activities. This is a project that aims to 
classify glitches from Virgo past runs, in order to get the training dataset
used in deep learning automatic classification pipelines. These results
are compatible with NICE application, which will provide that in
its glitches lists, **IPW** and **SGAW** pages.
